insomni'hack 2015 was a really fun CTF, as a matter of fact it took me all night to complete the 2 shellcoding challenges ! (still need practice xD)

As usual, other categories are also there as a backup. Exploitation challenges seemed feasible but there was a kernel challenge which was really hardcore.

Have fun !
